# The Parametric Voron

This repository contains Fusion 360 reconstructions of various printed parts from the Voron printers (https://vorondesign.com/). Unlike the CAD files provided by the Voron team, these files have full parametric design history turned on, and are easy to edit.

This is a community effort and it may take months, or even years, to recreate the full set of parts. If you would like to contribute, feel free to open a pull request. Parts are organized per Voron release, with the same directory structure and naming conventions used by the original Voron parts.

All parts are licensed under the GPLv3. For the purposes of the GPL license:

- "Source code" shall mean the original parametric Fusion 360 (F3D) file, with design history enabled, fully visible, and editable.
- "Object code" shall mean STEP files, STL files, and F3D files which have had the design history removed or disabled.
